  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/
    - images/categories/
    - images/settings/
    - images/sign_in/
    - images/state_images/
    - images/on_boarding/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/RobotoRegular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/RobotoLight.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/RobotoMedium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/RobotoBold.ttf
          weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
